# HiCPlus
Resolution Enhancement of HiC interaction heatmap 

## Dependency

* [Python] (https://www.python.org) (2.7.10) with Numpy and Scipy. We recommand use the  [Anaconda] (https://www.continuum.io) distribution to install Python. 
* [Theano] (https://github.com/Theano/Theano) (latest). At the time I wrote this, Theano 0.7.0 is already included in Anaconda. However, it is missing some crucial helper functions. You need to git clone the latest bleeding edge version since there isn't a version number for it:

```
$ git clone git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git
$ cd Theano
$ python setup.py develop
```
